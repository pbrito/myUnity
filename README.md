## Framework

- StratusFramework
In this repository you will find the source code to the Stratus Framework, a C# gameplay scripting framework for facilitating the composition of gameplay code for the Unity Engine. Its major tenet is to provide useful features with an easy to use interface while removing of as much boilerplate code from your scripts as possible.

I consider this framework very much a work in progress. Even so I find its core features, the Events and Actions systems to be rather robust, and can be used as is. The interface for them won't be changing in the future, as any future work on them will be adding features and fixing any discovered issues.

- Subnautica

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbrito/myUnity/master/img/subnautica.jpg"  width="300" height="169">

Subnautica was announced by Unknown Worlds Entertainment on December 17, 2013,[3] with Charlie Cleveland as the game director and lead gameplay programmer, and Hugh Jeremy as the producer.[1]


   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbrito/myUnity/master/img/subnauticaUnity.jpg"  width="300" height="169"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pbrito/myUnity/master/img/subnauticaUnity2.jpg"  width="300" height="169">


The development team opted to use the Unity engine rather than Spark, the engine used for the company's previous game, Natural Selection 2. Subnautica producer Hugh Jeremy justified this decision because of the different demands that the game places on the engine, and "because [the team] does not include people working on Spark, it's not appropriate for Subnautica to use Spark. By using Unity for Subnautica, Spark can continue to develop in certain directions, while Subnautica develops in others. To use Spark for Subnautica would be like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole."[14]

Opinion alert: the graphical differences between various engines are negligible these days, and we are choosing the engine that is best in terms of workflow, cost, and flexibility. Unity seems like the clear winner there. We think it's worth sacrificing cutting edge graphics tech for all that.
